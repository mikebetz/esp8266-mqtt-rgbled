mqtt-based controller for RGB lights (non-addressable)

I want to be able to set the hue/saturation/brightness (actually, red/green/blue) of a string of lights
This project helps to do this.

There is also a HAPNode.js accessory
and a Node-Red flow involved (which need to be added to the repository.)
